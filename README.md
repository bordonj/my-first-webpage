#### By _**Jennifer and Sue**_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_


## Description

_This is a website that contains both HTML, and a css (cascading style sheet), which styles the content. You can find out all the important information you need to survive in this world. You will not need any food or water, as long as you are able to read and understand the knowledge here. We introduce to you concepts and theories, such as my family, and the images that will enlighten your soul. Additionally, you can click my **Pet Page** at the bottom to see more information on my pet. Afterwards, you can navigate back to the main page by click my favorite things on the pet page._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _On the repository linked to "https://github.com/bordonj/my-first-webpage" - click the green button "Code" and clone the repository onto your local desktop_
* _On your desktop, there should now be a directory labeled "my-first-webpage"_
* _Click the folder "my-first-webpage" on your Desktop_
* _To open the HTML file, and view the website, click on the file index.html_
* _This should open up the website in a browser_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs
